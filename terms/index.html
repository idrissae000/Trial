        <h2>A. Services</h2>
        <p>
          We provide music promotion and marketing services, including social media promotion
          and campaign execution. We do our best to deliver strong results, but outcomes are
          never guaranteed. We do not promise any specific number of streams, followers,
          viral reach, playlist placements, or similar results.
        </p>

        <h2>B. Payments and Deposits</h2>
        <p>
          Pricing can vary and is confirmed after a consultation. If a deposit is required,
          the deposit is applied toward the final amount. Deposits are non-refundable once
          work has started. By purchasing services, you agree not to file chargebacks for
          services already delivered or actively in progress.
        </p>

        <h2>C. Turnaround Time</h2>
        <p>
          Campaign work typically begins within 1–3 business days after we receive required
          materials and payment. Timelines may vary based on current workload, platform
          conditions, and how quickly the client responds to requests.
        </p>

        <h2>D. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Clients must provide accurate links, assets, and necessary account details, and
          confirm they have all rights/permissions needed for promotion. Clients are also
          responsible for timely communication so campaigns can launch and run effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>E. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Idriss Music Promotions is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
          damages, including business or revenue losses. We are not responsible for platform
          policy changes, algorithm changes, account restrictions, takedowns, or third-party
          platform issues outside our control.
        </p>
